# Python PDF Merger
This is a simple Python script that can merge two PDF files into a single PDF file. It uses the PyPDF2 library to read and write PDF files.

## Usage
To use the script, run the following command:

- Copy code
- python3 pdfmerger.py
The script will prompt you to enter the filenames of the two PDF files you want to merge, as well as the filename for the merged PDF file.

## Requirements
This program was built using Python 3 and the PyPDF2 library. PyPDF2 can be installed using pip:

- Copy code
- pip install PyPDF2
The script has been tested on Kali Linux, but it should work on other Unix-based operating systems as well.

## How to Use on Windows
To use this program on Windows, you can follow these steps:

- Install Python 3 on your machine by downloading it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Open a command prompt by pressing Win + R, typing cmd, and hitting Enter.
- Navigate to the directory where you have saved pdfmerger.py.
- Install the PyPDF2 library by running the command pip install PyPDF2.
- Run the script using the command python pdfmerger.py.
- Follow the prompts to enter the filenames of the two PDF files you want to merge, as well as the filename for the merged PDF file.

### Note: Since the script was built on Kali Linux, you may need to install a Unix-like environment such as Cygwin or WSL to use it on Windows.
